TIme Series, Trend Prediction, Community Detection, Complex Networks

## Quick Summary

Analysing time series based on its topological features, introducing an algorithm in trend detection for stochastic time series based on community detection and network metrics. Advantages over traditional time series analysis being:
	
	* Adaptive number of classes with measurable strength

	* Better noise absorption

	* Representing time series in topological space instead of physical space (spatial, temporal or frequency spectral)

Experiments done on artificial and real dataset. Results shows that the proposed method can classify time series into local and global patterns, hence improved the prediction using time series
