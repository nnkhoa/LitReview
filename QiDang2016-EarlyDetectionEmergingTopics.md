# Early detection method for emerging topics based on dynamic bayesian networks in micro-blogging networks
# Qui Dang, Feng Gao, Yadong Zhou, 2016

## Keywords/Topics/Field of Study

Mirco-blogging networks, emerging topics, early detection, DBNs

## Quick Summary

Previous researches are suitable for large-scale detection, however fall short on early detection because of less informative properties in small smaple size. Hence, the author proposed a method based on Dynamic Bayesian Network: 
	
	* analyze topic diffusion process to find 2 main properties of emerging topics: attractiveness and key-node

	* build a DBN-based model based on conditional dependency of features selected from topic diffusion to extract emerging keywords (frequency and specific topology properties)

	* clustered emerging keywords into topics using co-occurences relation

Experiments was done on real data (Sina micro-blogging), in which concluded that the method is effective and capable of detecting emerging topics 1-2 hours earlier than preivous methods
