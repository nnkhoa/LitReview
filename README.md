# LitReview

This repository serves the purpose of writing/storing Literature Review of Scientific Paper that I've read. The idea is that this will (probably) help me collecting information and idea for my PhD research. Moreover, it will become useful whenever I decide to write a Literature Review for my thesis so that I don't drown in the enormous pile of paper that I've googled and downloaded.    
Each review will (usually) have the following structure:
* Keywords/Topics/Field of Study?
* What is the main purpose of the paper? What problem is it going to solve?
* General idea behind the solution
* The solution/method in detail
* Advantages/Disadvantages?
* Why does this paper concern me in any way?
File naming convention (to remind myself everytime I look at this README.md): 1stAuthorName-KeyConceptInTitle-Year-Relevancy(High/Mid/Low)

Owner's Note: Here's to another repository that I will probably(very likely to) left hanging and never update after a week or 2. I'll try my best tho
