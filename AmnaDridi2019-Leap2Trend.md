# Amna Dridi, Mohamed Medhat Gaber, R. Muhammad Atif Azad, Jagdev Bhogal

## Quick Sumnmary

Unlike previous attempts to detect emerging trends in research papers through biblography which are known to have problem in timeliness and content analysis, the literature proposed an approach using temporal word embeddings, dubbed as Leap2Trend. Leap2Trend tracks similarities between pairs of keywords overtime which yielded results suggesting the robustness and timeliness characteristics of the method.
